 - "Once hot, add the spring onions and fry while stirring for two minutes"
 - "Add the rice and salt and mix"
 - "Press the rice mixture down with a large spatula or fish slice so it is level all over and covering the base of the pan"
 - "Cook for 7 minutes, pushing the rice down now and then"
 - "Meanwhile, start making the salad by mixing garlic, chilli, sugar and lime juice in a bowl"
 - "Add the cucumber, edamame beans, soy saucen, peanuts and herbs to the bowl and toss it about"
 - "Flip the rice in chunks using the spatula and cook for another 7 minutes"
